            <p>Assignment 1 focused on our week 1 lesson: Good and Bad Design. Here I identified 3 everyday items each that are badly designed and 3 that have good designs and supported this by using some of Don Norman's principles of Design.</p>

            <p>With my knowledge of UI design and Aesthetics, I designed a restaurant review app called RIVOO displaying a couple of non-functional pages. They were supposed to show what the app would look like. Some of the pages included the login, loading and search results. I designed what the app would look like on an iPhone 13 pro, a Samsung s22 and a Windows Desktop.</p>

         <p>The first part focused on image editing. I edited an image provided by my professor and a personal image of mine. The second part was about Marshall McLuhan’s idea “The medium is the message” and required me to design a poster, static Instagram post, web banner and an infographic where each medium conveys a specific message that is Trent-related. My message was on Trent as a whole.
