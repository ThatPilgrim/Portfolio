        This is the loading screen for the app. The name of the app is Rivoo. It 
        sounds very similar to the word review. The idea behind that is so you can 
        remember the app when you think of the word review as this is the design for a restaurant review app. The logo is the fancy 
        capital letter R. The color is a shade of yellow to stimulate hunger.
     </p>

        <h2><a id="q2">QUESTION 2</a></h2>

            to login in through google, facebook or twitter with the samsung s22. On 
            the iphone, they can use either google or their apple account. You can sign up by tapping

        Here the user has searched for something using the search bar and the results have been 
        returned. A list of results is shown at the bottom of the screen. The user can scroll 
        through the result or select directly from the map using the pins. The pins on the map 
        are used to show where the restaurants are located. Essential details about the restaurants are 
        also there. The "Nearest me" feature is beside the search bar. When the user taps on the 
        icon it returns results the same way the search bar does except it shows results that are 
        specifically around your area. You can also use it to search for restaurants around a specific area.

        The settings page is shown. The profile icon, a sign-out option and the name of the user are there. Under this, there
        is a section to choose which specific setting you want.
        On the desktop, when you select a specific setting, it opens a pop-up beside it. There is always a light watermark
        of the company logo in the pop-up. The setting on the left becomes bold to indicate the setting you're on. The same thing happens but
        on the phones, you will be moved to another page entirely. When you click/tap on the side arrows for any setting, you can adjust that setting in depth.
        On the phones, it opens another page entirely.
