        In the before image, it was taken late at night and the frame of my laptop and the wall behind it are showing.
                  The text is a bit blurry and there are unnecessary things outside the quote which is most important. I <b>cropped</b> out
                  the unnecessary stuff. I also increased the image's overall <b>brightness</b> since it was dark and played around with
                  the <b>saturation</b>. I changed the <b>contrast</b> so the text stands out more and finally I <b>sharpened</b> it so that it would be easier
                  to read.

      <h2>PART 2</h2>

      <p class = "description">The message of my visualizations are centered on Trent as a whole. They're supposed to talk about Trent as if you were considering enrolling here. 
        They include some statistics about Trent and valuable information to convince you to enroll. Essentially, the message is about how good Trent is.
      </p>
<dl>
    <dt><h3><a id = "p2q1">QUESTION 1 (Instagram Post)</h3></a></dt>
    <dd><img src="img/ig post.png" height="450"> 
    <p>The picture simply attempts to point the viewer's eyes towards the writing on the green banner. It also shows the
        Trent Bata library facility in the background and how students are utilizing it to study. The green banner has a simple frame displaying
        some of Trent's best features. The colour and size of the "We welcome you" text are different from the rest which makes it stand out on the green
         background in order to grab the viewer's attention.
    </p></dd>

    <dt><h3><a id = "p2q2">QUESTION 2 (Web banner)</a></h3></dt>
    <dd><img src= "img/web banner.png" width="600">
    <p>I decided to use less words because a web banner is simply a third-party advertisement on a website and the user might not want to read
         too much of it. The phrase "equipped with amazing facilities" was used to describe the picture of the student centre and the bata Library, 
         both of which are excellent facilities. Additionally, the text is written in cursive, which is friendlier than a serif or monospace typeface. 
         The top left and bottom right corners each include a logo of Trent. </p></dd>

<dt><h3><a id = "p2q3">QUESTION 3 (Poster)</a></h3></dt>
<dd><img src ="img/poster.png" width="550">
<p>The poster focuses on the happy students. It makes use of the people's smiles to spark the viewer's interest in Trent since they appear to be happy,
     as the message indicates. Additionally, there is a tiny part with statistics that praise Trent as a school. To distinguish the headings on the poster 
     from the other texts, I also utilised a distinct colour and size for them.
</p></dd>

<dt><h3><a id = "p2q4"> QUESTION 4 (Infographic)</a></h3></dt>
<dd><img src="img/infographic.png" height="500" >
    <p>In comparison to the other visualizations, it has more detailed statistics. Students are the target audience for this infographic, hence the 
        statistics are centred on them. It mentions the student-run organisations and details the various services the school offers . Additionally,
         it discusses Trent's various scholarships, which are relevant to the viewers. More details about the school's former students, including two 
         Nobel Prize winners, are also included. Scholarship programmes were highlighted in bold toÂ bring attention to them. To make it clear, the heading 
         of the text in the green circle was underlined.
