     <h3><i>Taylor Swift's Case</i></h3>
     <p>
        Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, writers of 3LW’s song “Playa’s gon’ play” are suing Taylor Swift and co-writers for the similarities in the song lyrics for her hit song “shake it off”. They claim that “shake it off” lyrics were similar to 3LW’s, playa’s gon play. The similarities lie in the lyrics “playa's they gonna play” and “haters they gonna hate” which were repeated in Taylor's song. While they insisted that they “originated the linguistic combination of [players playing and haters hating]”, the court dismissed the argument (Harvey, n.d). They also pointed out that the lyrics of their song were "completely original and unique" when it was written(Davis, 2022).
        <br>On the other hand, Taylor denies ever hearing the song or listening to 3LW  prior to the lawsuit and argues that the similarities are just short phrases that can’t be protected by the Copyright Act(Harvey, n.d). She and her defendants also pointed out other records that the words “hater” and “player” have been used and can’t be deemed as creative(Harvey, n.d) In addition, Swift also stated that they did not invent the phrases either(Curto, 2022).  <br>

     <h3><i>My Personal belief</i></h3>
     <p>
        I do not think it should be. Although at the time of writing the song “playas gon’ play” the 
        phrases “players gonna play” and “haters gonna hate” were unique (Davis, 2022), however, it has 
        become very popular and common since then and has even been used in different
         songs even at the time of the release of “shake it off”. The phrases are very common 
        and I don’t think 3LW have Copyrights over them as they don’t show any real form of 
        originality. It's almost like trying to copyright “I love you” or “I hate you”, which is already 
        widely used. Taylor also talked about how she had never heard of the song prior 
        to the lawsuit due to her upbringing (McNeal, 2021) so how would she have copied what
         she never heard of in the first place? 
        <br>3LW also used the lyrics “Shot callers, they gonna call” which is structured the 
        same way as “Players, they gonna play” and “Ballers, they gonna ball” which shows
         that the lyrics aren’t particularly creative. The lyrics could have also included “fighters, 
        they gonna fight” and the like. In shake it off, Taylor also repeats the words hate and 
        play in her chorus. This wasn’t done by 3LW in their song which is a clear difference
         between the 2 lyrics.<br>

     <h3> <i>Possible Effects</i></h3>
     <p>
        I feel it would negatively affect the industry as a whole. The lawsuit against Taylor Swift
 for example wasn’t a very valid one. If more lawsuits like this were filed against artists, 
it would definitely increase their awareness and caution when making and releasing 
music. Artists, songwriters and even producers will have to take their time when 
preparing new music before it is released and check its lyrics and instrumentals 
thoroughly against any copyright violation. This may prolong the time for songs to be 
released which will reduce the overall industrial output. Essentially, less music will be 
Released or more time will be taken to release music in order to avoid a lawsuit or 
anything of that nature. 
<br>Also, a lot of time and emotions are invested into making 
songs. If after all the investments, it is a copyright infringement, people won’t want to put 
much effort into the creative process because it may go to waste. This reduces 
the quality of the music being released. People may also be scared of joining such an
 industry to avoid a waste of time and effort as well as the money they could lose if they
lose a lawsuit.

    <h2> PART 3</h2>

    <p>I chose a web video as my message's medium. I chose this format because it usually is longer than an Instagram post or a youtube ad and it allows me to present the message in a complete manner meaning, I don’t have to exclude some details in order to shorten the video’s runtime.<br>
        The video focuses on Trent itself and unlike the previous assignment that focused more on numbers and words, it focuses on images and videos which are easier to understand and for the brain to process. I display videos of Trent's different facilities as well as the exterior of some of its buildings showing just how good the school is and invites the viewer to enrol in the school at the end of the video.<br>
