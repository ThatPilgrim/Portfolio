    <h1>Good and bad design</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt><em><u><h3>Microwaves</h3></em></u></dt>
        <dd><p>I feel they are poorly designed for a couple of reasons. Firstly they poorly attempt
        to utilize conceptual models. They put different images of food that don't relate to the
        task it performs. Eg, a plate of chicken represents a defrost button for frozen food.
        Also, they don't have good signifiers. Microwaves just leave 9 numbers on the side panel. 
        That's not very helpful. It also has a low discoverability, it is just a box that opens 
        different buttons. It may be a complex safe.
       </p> </dd>

        <dt><em><u><h3>Glass stairs</h3></u></em></dt>
        <dd><p> One major flaw is the fact that it is possible to look under the skirts and dresses of 
            ladies. It is an affordance of the stairs but it isn't very good. It also a physical 
            constraint because glass isn't as strong as wood or cement which is used convetionally in
            making stairs. This is a security risk. It also doesnt really use signifiers to help people
            know they're stairs. It is possible to assume that it is an artwork and not stairs.
        </p></dd>

        <dt><u><em><h3>Parking Signs</h3></em></u></dt>
        <dd><p>One major design shortcoming of these signs is that you need certain knowledge to understand it.
            It is a constraint issue and sometimes it can eb cultural as well depending on the traffic laws
            of that place. No parking signs have no real signinfier indicating the physical place you're not 
            allowed to park. Where does the no parking area start and where does it end? Also, a line accross 
            the letter P is a bad conceptual model for no parking dince p doesn't really mean anything.

        <dt><u><em><h3>Nail clipper</h3></em></u></dt>
        <dd><p>It has a very high discoverability. It is very easy to figure out that you apply force on the lever
            and the blades close. This is also a natural mapping. You press the levers <strong>down</strong> and 
            the blades go <strong>down</strong>. When using them, they also provide instant feedback because you 
            will immediately know if the nails came off or not. The design of the blade also makes it easy to figure 
            out that its for a small curved object i.e your fingernails.
        </p></dd>

        <dt><u><em><h3>Screws and nails</h3></em></u></dt>
        <dd><p>For screws, you can immediately tell that you need a a certain type of object(a screwdriver) to use it. 
            This is a good discoverability feature. It is also sharp at the bottom so can tell it is used to pierce 
            different objects. The feedback is immediate because you will know that you have done the right thing with 
            it when you cant see the body anymore. Nails have a nutaral mapping as hitting them <strong>down</strong> 
            through and object moves them <strong>down</strong> into the object.

        <dt><u><em><h3>Cutlery</h3></em></u></dt>
        <dd><p>The prongs in forks make it clear it is used to pierce/hold down food. The sharp/rough side of a knife makes 
            it clear it's for cutting. The curve of a spoon make it clear it can be used to store liquids there or scooping.
            These are all good discoverability features. One popular constraint is how they're only brought out when there 
            is food which makes it clear that it's for food and limits the other possible uses. It provides instant feedback 
            because in the end,you will either have food in your mouth or on the plate.
